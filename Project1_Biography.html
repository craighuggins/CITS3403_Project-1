            <p>
                Craig Huggins was born in South Africa and moved to Australia with his family in 1999. He has mixed European ancestry, with his mother's side of the family originally from Germany, and his father's side of the family from Ireland and England. <br>
                He attended Poynter Primary School and Carine Senior High School, where he took an interest in Information Technology, Photography, and English subjects. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After High School, Craig found employment in the retail industry, where he worked while studying. He is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Western Australia, with majors in Data Science and Finance.
            </p>
